**Project Plan and Concept v.0.0.1**

---

### **Project Overview**

We are developing a chat feature that allows users to interact with an AI model via the OpenAI API. This chat will be integrated into an existing website and will enable users to converse with the AI without requiring login credentials. To manage usage and costs, we'll implement session management, interaction limitations, and data retention policies. The backend will be developed in Python using FastAPI and hosted on an existing Linux server. The frontend will be a standalone React component, easily integrated into the existing frontend.

  - **Cookie Consent:**
    - Displays a cookie banner if one is not already present.
    - Checks for existing cookie consent mechanisms on the host website.
  - **User Interaction Limitations:**
    - Disables the input field or send button until the AI response is received.
    - Prevents users from sending multiple messages simultaneously.
  - **Language Support:**
    - Supports English, German, and French.
  - **User Feedback Mechanism:**
    - Option for users to report issues or provide feedback directly from the chat interface.
    - Feature can be activated or deactivated via backend configuration.
  - **Visual Feedback:**
    - Loading indicators while waiting for AI responses.
    - Notifications for session expiration or errors.

#### **Backend Components**

- **API Endpoints:**

  - `POST /initialize_session`:
    - Initializes a new session.
    - Returns a unique session ID.
  - `POST /chat`:
    - Receives user messages along with the session ID.
    - Returns the AI's response.
  - `POST /feedback` (Optional):
    - Receives user feedback from the frontend.
    - Stores feedback for review.

- **Session Management:**

  - Stores session data and conversation history in SQLite.
  - Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
  - Session data retained for 6 months for troubleshooting.
  - Backend function to manually delete data earlier if needed.

- **OpenAI API Integration:**

  - Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` model initially.
  - Configured to allow easy switching to other models in the future.
  - Model parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens` are configurable.
  - Supports English, German, and French languages.

- **Concurrency Handling:**

  - Utilizes FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities to handle multiple simultaneous users efficiently.

- **Configuration Settings:**

  - Centralized configuration file or environment variables for easy adjustments.
  - Enables or disables features like user feedback.

---

### **3. Session Management and Data Storage**

- **Session Data:**

  - Unique session IDs assigned to each user.
  - Conversation histories stored for each session.
  - Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
  - Session data retained for 6 months.
  - Manual deletion capability via a backend function (e.g., SQL script).

- **Database:**

  - **SQLite** chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment.
  - Potential to migrate to a more robust database like PostgreSQL if needed in the future.
  - Stores session data, conversation histories, and user feedback.

---

### **4. Security Measures**

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

  - **Frontend:**
    - Sanitizes user input to prevent injection attacks.
    - Validates message length and content before sending.
  - **Backend:**
    - Re-validates all inputs received from the frontend.
    - Ensures session IDs are valid and correspond to active sessions.

- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**

  - **Client-Side:**
    - Prevents users from sending multiple messages simultaneously.
    - Disables input during AI response processing.
  - **Server-Side:**
    - Enforces rate limiting per session (e.g., maximum messages per minute).
    - Utilizes FastAPI middleware or third-party libraries.

- **API Key Management:**

  - Stores OpenAI API keys securely in environment variables or secured configuration files.
  - Ensures API keys are not exposed in frontend code or logs.

- **Error Handling:**

  - Provides clear error messages to users for common issues.
  - Backend logs errors and exceptions for debugging.

- **Data Encryption:**

  - Sensitive data encrypted in storage if necessary.
  - Secure communication protocols (HTTPS) used for data transmission.

---

### **5. Compliance and Data Privacy**

- **Cookie Consent and GDPR/CCPA Compliance:**

  - Implements a cookie banner if one is not already present on the website.
  - Obtains user consent before storing cookies or session data.
  - Offers a function to check for existing cookie consent mechanisms.

- **Data Retention and Privacy Policies:**

  - Session data and conversation histories retained for 6 months.
  - Data stored securely and used only for troubleshooting purposes.
  - Privacy policy updated to reflect data collection, usage, and retention policies.

- **Data Deletion:**

  - Backend function to manually delete session data earlier if needed.
  - Automatic deletion of data after the 6-month retention period.

- **User Rights:**

  - Provides information on how users can request data deletion.
  - Ensures compliance with user data rights under GDPR/CCPA.

---

### **6. Logging and Monitoring**

- **Backend Logging:**

  - Logs stored locally on the backend server.
  - Log contents include timestamps, session IDs, API response times, and errors.
  - Avoids logging sensitive information like user messages and AI responses unless necessary for debugging.

- **Log Management:**

  - Implements log rotation to manage file sizes and storage.
  - Secures log files to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Error Logging and Alerts:**

  - Sets up automated alerts for critical backend errors (e.g., via email or messaging platforms).
  - Prioritizes establishing basic logging before implementing alerts.

- **Monitoring Tools (Optional):**

  - Potential integration with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
  - Can be considered for future enhancements.

### **7. Deployment and Maintenance**

- **Deployment Strategy:**

  - **Containerization with Docker:**
    - Containerizes the backend application for consistency and scalability.
    - Simplifies deployment and environment management.
  - **Alternative Direct Deployment:**
    - Uses Uvicorn/Gunicorn with Nginx as a reverse proxy.
    - Suitable for current low-traffic expectations.
  - **Recommendation:**
    - Proceed with Docker containerization for better management and future-proofing.

- **Maintenance and Updates:**

  - Uses version control (e.g., Git) for code management.
  - Implements a simple CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  - Service restarts acceptable; minor disruptions are not a major concern.
