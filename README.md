**Final Project Plan and Concept**\n\n---\n\n### **Project Overview**\n\nWe are developing a chat feature that allows users to interact with an AI model via the OpenAI API. This chat will be integrated into an existing website and will enable users to converse with the AI without requiring login credentials. To manage usage and costs, we'll implement session management, interaction limitations, and data retention policies. The backend will be developed in Python using FastAPI and hosted on an existing Linux server. The frontend will be a standalone React component, easily integrated into the existing frontend.\n\n---\n\n### **1.
